Requirements
------------
SilverStripe 2.4 or newer


Installation
------------
copy the sqlite3 folder to your project root so that it becomes a sibling of cms, sapphire and co
add this to your _config.php

	define('SS_DATABASE_CLASS','SQLiteDatabase');

you are done!


Config
------
you can set the path for storing your SQLite db file or make use of the :memory: feature in sqlite3/_config.php like this:

	$databaseConfig = array(
		'path' => '/some/path',
		'memory' => true,
	);

make sure the webserver has sufficient privileges to write to that folder and that it is protected from external access.


Tested stacks
-------------
OSX leopard, XAMP with PHP 5.3.0, SQLite3.6.3


Open Issues
-----------
- SQLite3 may not work with certain modules as they are using custom SQL statements passed to the DB class directly ;(
- the SQLite3 locking behavior has to be explored, this is constantly causing trouble
- there is no real fulltext search yet and the build-in search engine is not ordering by relevance, check out fts3
- needs testing on different stacks


Things to note when using SQLite3
---------------------------------
- small, fast, zero configuration, single cross-platform disk file, comes with a CLI and In-Memory database feature
- sometimes the only feasible solution when you don't have access to the usual DBMSs like MySQL
- weakly and dynamically typed although this should have been caught in the adapter
- does not fully implement SQL-92 standard, e.g. the ALTER TABLE syntax is limited to adding and renaming fields
- references for sqlite are e.g. ADOBE (Photoshop Lightroom), Apple (Safari, Mail, iPod, iPhone) Mozilla (Firefox, Thunderbird), Google (Chrome)
- if you are looking for a SQLite client for debugging, the SQLite plugin for firefox may be worth a try
